# Objective-C-Stanford-University

This code covers the CS193P course "Developing iOS 7 Apps for iPhone and iPad" (2013 / 2014) by Stanford University.
In 2022 or later This is one of the best ways to learn Objective-C.
If you know how to work with UIKit, then this course will be very easy for you, as it also uses the amazing UIKit,
Your brain has already created enough snippets to manage the UIKit and one of the main methods for our brains to 
memorieze is linking, so all what your brain will do is linking the objective-c way of thinking to those snippets 
relate to the UIKit. 

If you are not fimilar with UIKit I would suggest you learn it first. The Objective-C syntax and way of thinking
is not something you are fimiliar with even if you know java and C. But it is up to you.
